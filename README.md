## ## ‚ú® Project Overview

This project provides a web-based system to classify military targets from Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery. It combines the powerful feature extraction capabilities of the **Scattering2D Transform** with a trained **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** for accurate classification.

The entire system is wrapped in a clean **Flask** web interface, allowing users to easily upload a SAR image and receive an instant prediction. This implementation was developed by **Brajesh** and is based on research concepts from defense AI applications at LRDE, DRDO.

## ## ‚≠ê Core Features

* **SAR Image Upload**: Supports grayscale `.jpg`, `.png`, and `.bmp` formats.
* **Automated Processing**: Automatically preprocesses images for the model.
* **Advanced Feature Extraction**: Uses the **Scattering2D Transform** (via the Kymatio library) to create robust feature sets.
* **Deep Learning Prediction**: Classifies targets using a pre-trained CNN model.
* **Web-Based UI**: A simple, clean interface for uploading images and viewing results.

## ## üß† How It Works

The classification pipeline is straightforward:
1.  **Upload**: The user uploads a grayscale SAR image via the Flask web UI.
2.  **Preprocess**: The image is loaded using OpenCV and resized to the model's required input shape (64x64).
3.  **Feature Extraction**: The **Scattering2D Transform** is applied to the image to extract stable and informative features.
4.  **Prediction**: The extracted features are fed into the pre-trained CNN model (`radarmodel.h5`) for classification.
5.  **Display**: The predicted class label is displayed to the user on the web page.
